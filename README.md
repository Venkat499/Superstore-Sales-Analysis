# Comprehensive Sales Analysis of Superstore Data

## Project Objective
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the Superstore sales data to identify key trends, top-performing categories, and valuable customer segments. The analysis is conducted in two parts:
1.  **In-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python to uncover patterns and calculate key metrics.
2.  **Interactive Executive Dashboard** built in Tableau to present the key findings in a clear, digestible format for business stakeholders.

## Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis with Python

In this phase, I used Python libraries (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean the data and perform a deep-dive analysis. The complete Python notebook can be found [here](./Sales%20Data%20EDA.ipynb).

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
* **Total Sales:** $2,261,537
* **Total Number of Orders:** 4,922
* **Average Sales Value per Order:** $459.48

### Key Findings & Visualizations

**1. Technology is the Top-Selling Category**
The bar chart clearly shows that the 'Technology' category drives the most revenue, making it a critical area for the business.

**2. The Consumer Segment Drives Over Half of All Sales**
The 'Consumer' segment is the most valuable, accounting for 51.3% of total sales. This highlights the importance of consumer-focused marketing and retention strategies.

## Part 2: Interactive Executive Dashboard in Tableau

Based on the insights from the Python analysis, I developed an interactive dashboard in Tableau to provide a high-level overview for business leaders. The dashboard allows users to dynamically filter data and explore trends themselves.
